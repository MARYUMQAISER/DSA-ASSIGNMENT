# DSA-ASSIGNMENT
Student: Maryum Qaiser
Course: BS Computer Science
Semester: [3rd]

Objective:
This repository contains my submission for the [ Sorting and Searching Algorithms] assignment. The goal of this assignment is to deepen my understanding of core data structures and algorithms, while demonstrating the ability to apply efficient problem-solving techniques.
Code Files:
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file (e.g., binary_search.py, quick_sort.py).
A main file (main.py) that demonstrates the application of each algorithm with sample inputs.
Documentation:
A comprehensive README with setup instructions, usage examples, and explanations of each algorithm.
A report.pdf providing an analysis of each algorithm’s time and space complexity, with real-world applications.
Data Structures Used:
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs (add or remove as relevant)
Key Algorithms:
Sorting Algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search
Additional Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm (include only if relevant)
Technologies:
Python, with testing done in Google Colab and/or PyCharm (mention other tools if used)
How to Run:
Instructions for running each algorithm and testing it with different data inputs can be found in the README file.
